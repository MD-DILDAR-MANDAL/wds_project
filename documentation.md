# Advanced Weapon Detection using a Modified VGG-16 for Public Safety

### 

### Introduction

Our Weapon Detection System enhances public safety by identifying potential threats in crowded places such as airports, schools, and public events.
Here we are proposing a Custom VGG-16 Deep Learning Model to detect weapons in real-time from surveillance footage.
This approach offers improved accuracy, speed, and reliability compared to traditional detection methods.

### Problem Statement

Real-time, accurate detection of weapons is essential to improve public safety. Limitations of Existing Technology: Traditional methods have high false positive/
negative rates and are less effective in detecting small, obscured objects.

### SOLUTION

A model that is built upon the VGG-16 model comprises of 25 layers, including convolution, pooling, ReLU, fully connected and classification layers.

### Application

- Public Security Use-case: 
  
  The weapon detector model can be integrated into surveillance systems to enhance public security. Cameras on streets, public parks, or shopping malls could be implemented with this model for real-time weapon detection, alerting law enforcement if any weapon is identified.

- Airport Security Use-case:
  
  This model can be used in airport security to assists with detecting hidden weapons in luggage during scanning, which can help increase the efficiency and accuracy of security checks.

- Gun Control Legislation Use-case
  
  The model can be deployed in security checkpoints at schools, government buildings, or other facilities where gun possession is prohibited. The model can help enforce gun control measures by automatically detecting and alerting authorities if any weapons are found.

- Social Media Monitoring Use-case
  
  The model could be used by social media platforms to scan and detect weapons in uploaded images or videos. The platforms could then take appropriate actions such as flagging, censoring, or removing the content if it goes against their policies.

- Virtual Reality/Game Development Use-case: 
  
  The weapon detector could be used in game development or virtual reality settings to create more immersive simulations or training exercises. It can process images or video feed to detect virtual weapons in real-time and trigger certain actions or effects based on gameplay mechanics.
