# Description

### Here are a few use cases for this project:

    - Public Security Use-case: The weapon detector model can be integrated into surveillance systems to enhance public security. Cameras on streets, public parks, or shopping malls could be implemented with this model for real-time weapon detection, alerting law enforcement if any weapon is identified.

    - Airport Security Use-case: This model can be used in airport security to assists with detecting hidden weapons in luggage during scanning, which can help increase the efficiency and accuracy of security checks.

    - Gun Control Legislation Use-case: The model can be deployed in security checkpoints at schools, government buildings, or other facilities where gun possession is prohibited. The model can help enforce gun control measures by automatically detecting and alerting authorities if any weapons are found.

    - Social Media Monitoring Use-case: The model could be used by social media platforms to scan and detect weapons in uploaded images or videos. The platforms could then take appropriate actions such as flagging, censoring, or removing the content if it goes against their policies.

    - Virtual Reality/Game Development Use-case: The weapon detector could be used in game development or virtual reality settings to create more immersive simulations or training exercises. It can process images or video feed to detect virtual weapons in real-time and trigger certain actions or effects based on gameplay mechanics.
